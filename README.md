# data-analysis-course-final-project
This is the final project in data analysis courseI took in Tel- Aviv University, graded with the score of 98.

The data for this project took from 'TidyTuesday' (a weekly data project in R from the R4DS online learning community), which took place in July 2020. The data comes from the Coffee Quality Database courtesy of Buzzfeed Data Scientist James LeDoux. The original data can be found on James' github.
Using R, me and my partner analyzed data of coffee ratings. There is data for both Arabica and Robusta beans, across many countries and professionally rated on a 0-100 scale. All sorts of scoring for things like acidity, sweetness, fragrance, balance, etc.
Our research focuses on the quality of coffee from the farmer's point of view - intending to provid a farmer who wish to open a coffee bean farm with tools for success in growing coffee.
